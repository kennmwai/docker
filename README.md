Dockerizing a Microservice Application over an AWS 
EC2 Instance or Docker Desktop and Deploying Containers using Docker Compose 

INTRODUCTION  
This research project focuses on “Dockerizing a Microservice Application over an AWS EC2 Instance or 
Docker Desktop and Deploying Containers using Docker Compose”. It implements a “flight-service” 
maven application provided as a project resource to demonstrate the student's understanding of 
Docker and the use of containers to deploy microservices. The project documents the steps and 
processes involved in containerizing the flight-service application and describes the tools and 
resources used for the implementation of the project. Key terminologies are defined, and 
demonstrations of steps and processes are provided as screenshots within this document. All 
demonstrations during this exercise were performed using Docker Desktop v4.24.2.  
The project discusses Docker and describes the relationship between Docker Images, Docker 
Containers, and Docker files. A brief discussion on the phrase “don’t use docker-compose in 
production” summarizes the student’s opinion on the phrase with a closer look at the challenges of 
implementing a dockerize microservice application and deploying containers using docker-compose .
